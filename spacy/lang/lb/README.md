Initial rules of basic NLP functions for Luxembourgish

So far has been done:
- basic tokenisation
- stopwords
- lemmatisation

TODO:

- tokenize cliticised definite article "d'" as token of its own: d'Kanner > [d'] [Kanner]
- treat other apostrophes within words as part of the word: [op d'mannst], [fir d'Ã©ischt] (= exceptions)
- norm execptions: find a possibility to deal with the zillions of spelling variants
