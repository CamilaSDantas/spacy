def _roc_auc_score(y_true, y_score):
    """Compute Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC AUC)
    from prediction scores.

    Note: this implementation is restricted to the binary classification task

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : array, shape = [n_samples] or [n_samples, n_classes]
        True binary labels or binary label indicators.
        The multiclass case expects shape = [n_samples] and labels
        with values in ``range(n_classes)``.

    y_score : array, shape = [n_samples] or [n_samples, n_classes]
        Target scores, can either be probability estimates of the positive
        class, confidence values, or non-thresholded measure of decisions
        (as returned by "decision_function" on some classifiers). For binary
        y_true, y_score is supposed to be the score of the class with greater
        label. The multiclass case expects shape = [n_samples, n_classes]
        where the scores correspond to probability estimates.

    Returns

    Note: this implementation is restricted to the binary classification task.

    Parameters
    ----------

    y_true : array, shape = [n_samples]
        True binary labels. If labels are not either {-1, 1} or {0, 1}, then
        pos_label should be explicitly given.

    y_score : array, shape = [n_samples]
        Target scores, can either be probability estimates of the positive
        class, confidence values, or non-thresholded measure of decisions
        (as returned by "decision_function" on some classifiers).

    Returns
    -------
    fpr : array, shape = [>2]
        Increasing false positive rates such that element i is the false
        positive rate of predictions with score >= thresholds[i].

    tpr : array, shape = [>2]
        Increasing true positive rates such that element i is the true
        positive rate of predictions with score >= thresholds[i].

    thresholds : array, shape = [n_thresholds]
        Decreasing thresholds on the decision function used to compute
        fpr and tpr. `thresholds[0]` represents no instances being predicted
        and is arbitrarily set to `max(y_score) + 1`.

    Notes
    -----
    Since the thresholds are sorted from low to high values, they
    are reversed upon returning them to ensure they correspond to both ``fpr``
    and ``tpr``, which are sorted in reversed order during their calculation.
