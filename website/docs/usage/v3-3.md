## Notes about upgrading from v3.2 {#upgrading}

### Pipeline package version compatibility {#version-compat}

> #### Using legacy implementations
>
> In spaCy v3, you'll still be able to load and reference legacy implementations
> via [`spacy-legacy`](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-legacy), even if the
> components or architectures change and newer versions are available in the
> core library.

When you're loading a pipeline package trained with an earlier version of spaCy
v3, you will see a warning telling you that the pipeline may be incompatible.
This doesn't necessarily have to be true, but we recommend running your
pipelines against your test suite or evaluation data to make sure there are no
unexpected results.

If you're using one of the [trained pipelines](/models) we
provide, you should run [`spacy download`](/api/cli#download) to update to the
latest version. To see an overview of all installed packages and their
compatibility, you can run [`spacy validate`](/api/cli#validate).

If you've trained your own custom pipeline and you've confirmed that it's still
working as expected, you can update the spaCy version requirements in the
[`meta.json`](/api/data-formats#meta):

```diff
- "spacy_version": ">=3.2.0,<3.3.0",
+ "spacy_version": ">=3.2.0,<3.4.0",
```

### Updating v3.2 configs

To update a config from spaCy v3.2 with the new v3.3 settings, run
[`init fill-config`](/api/cli#init-fill-config):

```cli
$ python -m spacy init fill-config config-v3.2.cfg config-v3.3.cfg
```

In many cases ([`spacy train`](/api/cli#train),
[`spacy.load`](/api/top-level#spacy.load)), the new defaults will be filled in
automatically, but you'll need to fill in the new settings to run
[`debug config`](/api/cli#debug) and [`debug data`](/api/cli#debug-data).
