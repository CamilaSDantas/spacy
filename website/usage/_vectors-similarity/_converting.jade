+h(3, "converting") Converting word vectors for use in spaCy

p
    |  Custom word vectors can be trained using a number of open-source libraries,
    |  such as Gensim, Fast Text, or Tomas Mikolov's original word2vec implementation.
    |  Most word vector libraries output an easy-to-read text-based format, where
    |  each line consists of the word followed by its vector. For everyday use,
    |  we want to convert the vectors model into a binary format that loads faster
    |  and takes up less space on disk. The easiest way to do this is the
    |  `spacy init-model` command-line utility:

+code.
    wget https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/fasttext-vectors/word-vectors-v2/cc.la.300.vec.gz
    spacy init-model /tmp/la_vectors_wiki_lg -v cc.la.300.vec.gz

p
    |  This will output a spaCy model directory in the directory /tmp/la_vectors_wiki_lg,
    |  You can then pass the path to this directory to `spacy.load()`.
    |  The model directory will have a vocab/ directory with the strings, lexical entries
    |  and word vectors from the input vectors model. The `spacy init-model` command
    |  supports a number of archive formats for the word vectors: the vectors can be
    |  in plain text (.txt), Zip file, (.zip), or tarred and zipped (.tgz).
