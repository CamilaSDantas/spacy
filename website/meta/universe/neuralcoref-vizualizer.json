    "description": "In short, coreference is the fact that two or more expressions in a text \u2013 like pronouns or nouns \u2013 link to the same person or thing. It is a classical Natural language processing task, that has seen a revival of interest in the past two years as several research groups applied cutting-edge deep-learning and reinforcement-learning techniques to it. It is also one of the key building blocks to building conversational Artificial intelligences.",
