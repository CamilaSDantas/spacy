Lemmy also supports training on your own dataset. The model currently included in Lemmy was evaluated on the Danish Universal Dependencies dev dataset and scored an accruacy > 99%.\n\nYou can use Lemmy as a spaCy extension, more specifcally a spaCy pipeline component. This is highly recommended and makes the lemmas easily accessible from the spaCy tokens. Lemmy makes use of POS tags to predict the lemmas. When wired up to the spaCy pipeline, Lemmy has the benefit of using spaCy\u2019s builtin POS tagger.", "github": "sorenlind/lemmy", "pip": "lemmy", "code_example": ["import da_custom_model as da # name of your spaCy model", "import lemmy.pipe", "nlp = da.load()", "", "# create an instance of Lemmy's pipeline component for spaCy", "pipe = lemmy.pipe.load()", "", "# add the comonent to the spaCy pipeline.", "nlp.add_pipe(pipe, after='tagger')", "", "# lemmas can now be accessed using the `._.lemma` attribute on the tokens", "nlp(\"akvariernes\")[0]._.lemma"], "thumb": "https://i.imgur.com/RJVFRWm.jpg", "author": "S\u00f8ren Lind Kristiansen", "author_links": {"github": "sorenlind"}, "category": ["pipeline"], "tags": ["lemmatizer", "danish"]}
